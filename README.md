## User Stories and Separate Concerns for a Quote Generator in MVC

**As a user, I want to...**

**1. Generate a random quote:**

* Click on a button or perform an action to generate a random quote from a collection.
* The quote should include the quote text and optionally the author's name.

**2. Browse through quotes (optional):**

* Optionally, be able to browse through a list of quotes with authors displayed.
* Click on a specific quote to view it in full detail.

**3. Search for quotes by keyword (optional):**

* Optionally, be able to search for quotes containing a specific keyword in the text or author's name.

**4. Share quotes (optional):**

* Share quotes on social media platforms or copy them to the clipboard for further use.

**Separate Concerns:**

**1. Model:**

* `Quote` class: Stores information about each quote (text, author, etc.).

**2. Controller:**

* `QuoteController`: Handles requests for generating random quotes, browsing quotes (optional), searching for quotes (optional), and sharing quotes (optional).

**3. View:**

* `Quote` view: Displays a randomly generated quote with optional author information.
* `QuotesList` view (optional): Displays a list of quotes with authors for browsing.
* `SearchQuotes` view (optional): Provides a search form for searching quotes.
* `_Layout` view: Provides the overall website layout and navigation.

**4. Data Access (Optional):**

- Implement a data access layer (e.g., using a database or local file) to store and retrieve quotes. You could also consider fetching quotes from an external API.

**5. Services (Optional):**

- Implement services for specific tasks like fetching quotes from an external API (if applicable), managing user preferences for sharing platforms, or handling social media interactions (if implemented).

**This is a basic set of user stories and separate concerns for the Quote Generator. You can extend or modify it based on your specific requirements and desired functionalities.**

Here are some additional features you could consider:

* Allow users to filter quotes by category or theme.
* Enable users to save their favorite quotes for later access.
* Integrate social media sharing functionalities directly within the application.
